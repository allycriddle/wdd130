        <p class="para1"> I'm student at Brigham Young University Idaho pursuing a bachelor's degree in business management marketing with a minor in photography. I am excited about learning about the marketing industry and to be able to gain new skills in my journey of marketing and business, especially when it comes to content marketing. I am currently working as a media specialist for the College Success Department on the BYU Idaho campus. This involves a range of responsibilities, from creating graphics for courses within the program, to designing web pages for each course within the program. I love learning from others, making genuine connections, and how I can be of help to others. Experience with Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office programs, and past job experience sets me apart from other candidates, as well as my work ethic, ability to work in teams or individually, and my ability to connect with potential clients. Since taking my first marketing class in college, I have been hooked on the idea of working in the marketing industry. I love the world of marketing and I can't wait to prove myself an asset in that field. </p>
