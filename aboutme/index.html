    <h2>Ally Criddle</h2>
    <p>Hey friends!</p>
    <p>My name is Ally and I am a senior here at BYU Idaho. I am brand new to all things web design and development but so far I am having a lot of fun! I am studying marketing, so I decided to take this course to round out my education a little bit. My minor is photography, and I have been a wedding photographer for about 5 years. So on the off chance you are luckier than I am and are in need of a wedding photographer, I know a girl. (It's me, I'm girl lol).</p> 
    <p>I am from a small town called Mountain Home, it's in the Boise Area on the other side of Idaho. I never know what to tell people when they ask about hobbies because between a full load of classes, church callings, two jobs, and homework, I rarely have time to do anything else but eat and sleep. However, during the summer I love to spend my time outdoors and exploring. I am the proud owner of a lifetime pass to all the National Parks, so it's on my bucketlist to hit all of them. I also love watercoloring, reading, taking naps, and long walks to the fridge. I love to travel and leave my phone turned off for days on end (kind of weird for a marketing major, I know haha). I think that's pretty much it for me! </p>
    <p>I am excited to learn more about coding and web design and to be able to work with all of you!</p>
